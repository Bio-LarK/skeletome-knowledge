Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) is characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity, and digits and is transmitted as an X-linked dominant condition with lethality in males (Ferrante et al., 2001). Thickened alveolar ridges and abnormal dentition, including absent lateral incisors, are additional characteristics of OFD1. The central nervous system may also be involved in as many as 40% of cases. Although these clinical features overlap those reported in other forms of orofaciodigital syndrome, OFD1 can be easily distinguished from among these by its X-linked dominant inheritance pattern and by polycystic kidney disease, which seems to be specific to type I.

Since the CXORF5 gene localizes to the centrosome and basal body of primary cilia, OFD1 is considered to be a ciliopathy (Chetty-John et al., 2010).
