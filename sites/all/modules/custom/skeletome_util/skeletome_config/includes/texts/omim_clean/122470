The Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS) is a multisystem malformation syndrome recognized primarily on the basis of characteristic facial dysmorphism, including low anterior hairline, arched eyebrows, synophrys, anteverted nares, maxillary prognathism, long philtrum, thin lips, and 'carp' mouth, in association with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation and, in many cases, upper limb anomalies. However, there is wide clinical variability in this disorder, with milder phenotypes that may be difficult to ascertain on the basis of physical features  (summary by Rohatgi et al., 2010).

Genetic Heterogeneity of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

About 50 to 60% of the cases of CDLS are due to mutation in the NIPBL gene (Musio et al., 2006; Rohatgi et al., 2010).

An X-linked form of the disorder (CDLS2;) can be caused by mutation in the SMC1A gene, which accounts for about 5% of cases. A mild variant of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS3;) has been related to mutation in the SMC3 gene. All 3 genes, NIPBL, SMC1A, and SMC3, encode components of the cohesin complex.
