Split-hand/split-foot malformation is a limb malformation involving the central rays of the autopod and presenting with syndactyly, median clefts of the hands and feet, and aplasia and/or hypoplasia of the phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals (Elliott and Evans, 2006).

For additional phenotypic information and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity in this disorder, see SHFM1.
