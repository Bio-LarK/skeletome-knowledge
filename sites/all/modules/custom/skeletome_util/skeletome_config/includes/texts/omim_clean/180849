Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by mental retardation, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, broad thumbs and halluces, and dysmorphic facial features. The facial appearance is striking, with highly arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, down-slanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, beaked nose with the nasal septum, highly arched palate, mild micrognathia, and characteristic grimacing or abnormal smile. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of tumor formation (Rubinstein and Taybi, 1963; review by Hennekam, 2006).

Genetic Heterogeneity of Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome

Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1) constitutes about 50 to 70% of patients with the disorder. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-2 (RSTS2;) comprises about 3% of patients and is due to primarily to de novo heterozygous mutation in the EP300 gene on chromosome 22q13 (Bartsch et al., 2010).
