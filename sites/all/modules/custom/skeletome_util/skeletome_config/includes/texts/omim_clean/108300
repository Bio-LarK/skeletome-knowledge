Stickler syndrome is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities. Most forms of Stickler syndrome are characterized by the eye findings of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, retinal detachment, and cataracts. Additional findings may include midline clefting (cleft palate or bifid uvula), Pierre Robin sequence, flat midface, sensorineural or conductive hearing loss, mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Stickler syndrome type III is a nonocular form of the disorder (summary by Baker et al., 2011).

Genetic Heterogeneity of Stickler Syndrome

See for a form of Stickler syndrome type I which is solely or predominantly ocular and is also caused by mutation in the COL2A1 gene. Stickler syndrome type II (STL2;), sometimes called the beaded vitreous type, is caused by mutation in the COL11A1 gene on chromosome 1p21. Stickler syndrome type III (STL3;), sometimes called the nonocular form, is caused by mutation in the COL11A2 gene on chromosome 6p21. These forms of Stickler syndrome are autosomal dominant. Stickler syndrome type IV, an autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutation in the COL9A1 gene (<a href="/entry/120210#0002">120210.0002</a>) on chromosome 6q12-q14.
