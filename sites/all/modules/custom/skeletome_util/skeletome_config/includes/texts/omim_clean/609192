The Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant aortic aneurysm syndrome with widespread systemic involvement. LDS type 1 is characterized by the triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate. Loeys et al. (2006) assigned patients to the LDS type 1 category if craniofacial involvement consisting of cleft palate, craniosynostosis, or hypertelorism was observed. Patients assigned to the LDS type 2 category had no evidence of these findings, but some had an bifid uvula. The natural history of both types is characterized by aggressive arterial aneurysms and a high rate of pregnancy-related complications.

Genetic Heterogeneity of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome

LDS1A and LDS2A are both caused by mutation in the TGFBR1 gene; LDS1B and LDS2B are both caused by mutation in the TGFBR2 gene. Another form of type 1 Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1C;), which is associated with early-onset osteoarthritis, is caused by mutation in the SMAD3 gene. LDS1A and LDS1B are clinically indistinguishable, as are LDS2A and LDS2B.
