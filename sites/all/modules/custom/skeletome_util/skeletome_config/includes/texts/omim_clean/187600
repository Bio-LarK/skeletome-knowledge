Thanatophoric dysplasia is a severe short-limb dwarfism syndrome that is usually lethal in the perinatal period. Norman et al. (1992) classified cases of TD into subtypes based on the presence of curved as opposed to straight femurs; patients with straight, relatively long femurs always had associated severe cloverleaf skull and were designated TD type II (TD2), while TD cases with curved, short femurs with or without cloverleaf skull were designated TD type I (TD1) (Langer et al., 1987).
