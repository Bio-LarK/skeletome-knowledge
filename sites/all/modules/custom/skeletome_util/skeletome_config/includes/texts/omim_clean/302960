Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by punctiform calcification of the bones. X-linked dominant CDP, also known as Conradi-Hunermann syndrome, is the most well-characterized form. See for a possible autosomal dominant form of CDP. There are 2 brachytelephalangic forms of CDP: an X-linked recessive form (CDPX1;), caused by mutation in the ARSE gene, and a possible autosomal form (BCDP;). There is also an autosomal dominant tibia-metacarpal type. In addition, CDP can be caused by maternal vitamin K deficiency or warfarin teratogenicity (see).
