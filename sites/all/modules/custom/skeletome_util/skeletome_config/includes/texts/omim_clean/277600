Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and lens abnormalities (Faivre et al., 2002).

Genetic Heterogeneity of Weill-Marchesani Syndrome

In addition to autosomal recessive WMS1, a phenotypically similar, autosomal dominant form of WMS (WMS2;) is caused by mutation in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15q21. A WMS-like syndrome, in which affected individuals exhibit key features of WMS but do not display brachydactyly or decreased joint flexibility, is caused by mutation in the ADAMTS17 gene on chromosome 15q24.
