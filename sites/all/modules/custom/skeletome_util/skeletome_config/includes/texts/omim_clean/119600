See for a discussion of the combination of cleidocranial dysplasia and parietal foramina. Pycnodysostosis and mandibuloacral dysplasia are disorders to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cleidocranial dysplasia. Acroosteolysis and bone sclerosis with tendency to fracture are differentiating features of pycnodysostosis.

Mundlos (1999) provided a review of the clinical features of cleidocranial dysplasia and the molecular basis of this disorder.
