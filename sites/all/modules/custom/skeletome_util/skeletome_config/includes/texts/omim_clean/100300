Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is characterized by the congenital absence of skin, known as 'aplasia cutis congenita,' usually limited to the scalp vertex, and transverse limb defects. The clinical features are highly variable and can also include vascular defects, congenital cardiac malformations, and other abnormalities (summary by Verdyck et al., 2006).

Sybert (1985) and Frieden (1986) provided reviews.

Genetic Heterogeneity of Adams-Oliver Syndrome

An autosomal recessive form of Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS2) is caused by mutation in the DOCK6 gene on chromosome 19p13.2.
