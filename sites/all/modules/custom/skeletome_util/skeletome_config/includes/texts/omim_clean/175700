Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome is characterized by frontal bossing, scaphocephaly, and hypertelorism associated with pre- and postaxial polydactyly and variable syndactyly. The phenotype shows variable expressivity and can also include craniosynostosis. Affected individuals usually have normal psychomotor development (summary by Gorlin et al., 2001).
