Campomelic dysplasia is a disorder of the newborn characterized by congenital bowing and angulation of long bones, together with other skeletal and extraskeletal defects. Up to two-thirds of affected XY individuals have a gradation of genital defects or may develop as phenotypic females (Wagner et al., 1994).
