3M syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, severe prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and normal mental development. The main skeletal anomalies are long, slender tubular bones, reduced anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral bodies, and delayed bone age. Other skeletal manifestations include joint hypermobility, joint dislocation, winged scapulae, and pes planus (summary by Badina et al., 2011).
