                    <p>
                        All entries contain an abstract. Abstracts are collaboratively written by members of the skeletal dysplasia
                        community. To ensure the highest quality, only expert users will be given editing rights for the abstracts.
                        The names of the contributors are listed above the abstract. Click a contributors name to see the
                        contributor's profile page.

                    <p>
                        Statements allow every user to contribute their knowledge without jeopardising the integrity of the main
                        abstract. Any logged-in user can create a Statement. Statements can be important clinical observations,
                        pathophysiological insights, etc. Statements can be discussed by other users by clicking on the 'Discuss'
                        button next to the Statement. Statements that are positively reviewed by the user community will be
                        integrated into the main abstract by the editors.

                        X-rays are contributed by members of the skeletal dysplasia community to illustrate the radiographic
                        appearance of the respective bone dysplasia. To ensure the highest quality, only expert users with
                        editing rights can contribute x-rays. Click on a thumbnail to see a larger version of the x-ray.

                    <p>
                        Every bone dysplasia entry contains a list of clinical features deemed characteristic for this disorder.
                        The original list was sourced from [OMIM], but can be edited by the skeletal dysplasia community.
                        To ensure the highest quality, only expert users with editing rights can add or delete a clinical feature.
                        The clinical feature vocabulary is based on the [Human Phenotype Ontology]. Clinical features are sorted
                        by Information Content. Information Content is a measure of how specific a feature is for a certain
                        bone dysplasia. Click [here] for more information on Information Content.
